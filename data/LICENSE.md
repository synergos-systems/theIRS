With the amount of use and profits surrounding non-profit IRS data, I find it beneficial to make the system free-to-use; however, the selling of data is possible.

The main reason is because the parser should be supported by those who use it, but to restrict the data would be unbeneficial.

One issue Synergos would like to avoid is the distribution of software.

Selling an API to consumers is one thing but to package software and to profit from it, goes against the culture surrounding this data.

Therefore, enjoy the data and support us if you'd like any personal or business inquiries can be sent to synergossystems@proton.me
