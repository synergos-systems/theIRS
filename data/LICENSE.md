## License

- ðŸ§  **Code** is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](./LICENSE) â€” any use must be open-sourced.
- ðŸ“¦ **Data** in `/data` is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](./LICENSE) â€” any use must be open-sourced, any forks maintain this license over the data.

The code produced by this system will be covered under the GPL license since there are many resellers of the data, and we don't need anymore.

This repo is for producing free reusable data that should be distributed freely.

Therefore, the restricted activities include but are not limited to: donations for private api access, paywalls, subscriptions, and any form of money-exchange to gain access to the data.

The users are NOT required to provide the full dataset for download but can certainly host data if they would like.

Yes, this is not a common approach but after observing this landscape for a short while, I realize there are organizations that need freedom from large paywalls and subs.
